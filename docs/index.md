jspsych-psychophysics is a plugin for conducting Web-based psychophysical experiments using [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/) (de Leeuw, 2015).
This plugin can be used free of charge under the MIT license.

# What you can do with the jspsych-psychophysics plugin
- You can present a set of stimuli asynchronously. In other words, the plugin can set stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA).
- You can present visual stimuli at intended coordinates.
- You can present moving objects.

# Advantage of the jspsych-psychophysics plugin
- This plugin presents visual stimuli synchronized with the refresh of the display using the requestAnimationFrame method. As a result, the display duration would be more accurate.
- The SOA between visual stimuli with the plugin was more accurate than that without the plugin. See

# What kinds of stimuli you can present with the jspsych-psychophysics plugin
