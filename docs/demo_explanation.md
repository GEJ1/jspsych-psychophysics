The cross object can be used to present a fixation point. In this demo, moving two cross are presented. 

## [draw_part_of_image.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/draw_part_of_image.html)

This file demonstrates how to use the drawFunc with the image object. You need not to use the drawFunc when you present images normally. But if you want to modify the images, for example, if you want to present a part of the image, the drawFunc is useful.

## [draw_two_images_repeatedly.html](https://www.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kurokid/jspsychophysics/demos/draw_two_images_repeatedly.html)

This file demonstrates how to present two images repeatedly until a participant responds to them. This demonstration can be applied to the study on like change blindness.

You can also make the participants respond using a mouse instead of a keyboard using the **response_type** property. See, demos/localize-circle.html.
